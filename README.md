# churn-prediction-DS
A complete beginner-friendly data science project for predicting customer churn using Python. Includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning model development with evaluation.
# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction Project

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., stop using a service). It is a beginner-friendly project that walks through a typical data science workflow including:

## 📌 Objectives
- Understand and explore the customer churn dataset
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Build and evaluate machine learning models
- Interpret results and visualize performance
